                        journey, I have had the privilege of working closely with skilled
                        designers and backend developers, refining my skills in creating
                        seamless and dynamic user interfaces. I have always worked in
                        environments where I had to prove myself, be flexible, and be an
                        excellent problem-solver. With my ability to adapt and my deep
                        desire to learn something new every day, I have proven myself as a
                        useful resource to everyone I worked with.

                        Now I embark on a new journey where I want to find new challenges
                        and meet new faces. I want to be able to make an impact and create
                        engaging and simple, but eye-catching user interfaces. I hope to be
                        able to use my 3+ years of knowledge in frontend development, and
                        all the experience I gathered in backend development, UI design,
                        SEO, accessibility, and creating responsive webpages end-to-end to
                        benefit both me and those around me.
